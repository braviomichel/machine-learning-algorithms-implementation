# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented within its own directory. The algorithms included are:

1. **K-Means**: A clustering algorithm used to partition data into K clusters based on similarity.
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A deep learning algorithm commonly used for image classification and object recognition.
3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
4. **Decision Tree**: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
6. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

## Usage

Each algorithm directory contains its implementation along with example datasets and usage instructions. To use a specific algorithm, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file.
